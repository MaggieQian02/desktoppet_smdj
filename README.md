This is a Python project of a desktop pet of my favourite characters Shimok and Dongjae from the K-drama Stranger.

The code is based on kivy package, referenced to this tutorial https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1H1QPYJEAA/?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_default_collection.content.click&vd_source=c4d81b01f0d7accc2eea854dc487972a.

The animations are drawn by myself referenced to the templates from http://xhslink.com/m/30P4Oo5BbT7, and http://xhslink.com/m/63HFQjpeynt.

More functions of user interaction are being created...
