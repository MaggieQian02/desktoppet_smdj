This is a Python project of a desktop pet of my favourite characters Shimok and Dongjae from the K-drama Stranger.

The code is based on kivy package, referenced to this tutorial https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1H1QPYJEAA/?spm_id_from=333.1007.top_right_bar_window_default_collection.content.click&vd_source=c4d81b01f0d7accc2eea854dc487972a, with some help from ChatGPT.

The animations are drawn by myself referenced to the templates from http://xhslink.com/m/30P4Oo5BbT7,  http://xhslink.com/m/7nlS5ITJaUR, http://xhslink.com/m/37EpkTHceMD, and http://xhslink.com/m/63HFQjpeynt.

Functions include:
    - On default animation, one click to stop moving, click again to stop animating; hold and drag
    - Select and switch to different animations
    And maybe more to come...

It is also planed to record a video for user instruction.
